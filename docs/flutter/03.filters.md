# Filters

## `DataFilter`

The `DataFilter` class provides a structure for filtering and querying data. It supports pagination, sorting, and basic filtering operations. It is designed to be used with a list of `FilterField` objects, which specify the filtering criteria for individual fields.

**Properties:**

- `int skip` – The number of entities to skip in a request.
- `int take` – The number of entities to take in a request.
- `String? orderBy` – The field name to order by.
- `String? orderType` – The order orientation (`"ASC"` or `"DESC"`).
- `String? search` – The search field.
- `String? viewCode` – The document view code.

**Methods:**

- `Map<String, dynamic> toJSON()` – Converts the filter to a JSON representation.
- `void fromJSON(dynamic json)` – Populates the filter from a JSON object.
- `String toString()` – Returns a JSON string representation of the filter.
- `int nextPage()` – Calculates the index of the next page for pagination.

## `FilterField`

The `FilterField` class is the base class for specific filter types. It includes common filter operations as constants and implements JSON serialization and deserialization.

**Constants:**

- `String less` – Less than operation.
- `String lessEqual` – Less than or equal to operation.
- `String greater` – Greater than operation.
- `String greaterEqual` – Greater than or equal to operation.
- `String equal` – Equal to operation.
- `String notEqual` – Not equal to operation.
- `String contain` – Contains operation.
- `String notContain` – Does not contain operation.
- `String startWith` – Starts with operation.
- `String notStartWith` – Does not start with operation.
- `String endWith` – Ends with operation.
- `String notEndWith` – Does not end with operation.
- `String inList` – In list operation.
- `String notInList` – Not in list operation.
- `String search` – Search operation.
- `String viewCode` – View code operation.

**Properties:**

- `final String name` – The name of the filter field.

**Methods:**

- `String toString()` – Returns a JSON string representation of the filter field.

## `AbstractIdFilter<T>`

The `AbstractIdFilter` class provides filtering operations for ID fields of type `T`. It allows filtering by a specific ID, excluding an ID, or working with lists of IDs.

**Properties:**

- `List<T>? inList` – List of IDs to match.
- `List<T>? notInList` – List of IDs to exclude.
- `T? equal` – Specific ID to match.
- `T? notEqual` – ID to exclude.

**Methods:**

- `Map<String, dynamic> toJSON()` – Converts the filter to a JSON representation.
- `void fromJSON(dynamic json)` – Populates the filter from a JSON object.

---

## `AbstractNumberFilter<T>`

The `AbstractNumberFilter` class provides filtering operations for number fields of type `T`. It supports operations like greater than, less than, equal to, and not equal to.

**Properties:**

- `T? greaterEqual` – Value to match greater than or equal to.
- `T? lessEqual` – Value to match less than or equal to.
- `T? greater` – Value to match greater than.
- `T? less` – Value to match less than.
- `T? equal` – Value to match.
- `T? notEqual` – Value to exclude.

**Methods:**

- `Map<String, dynamic> toJSON()` – Converts the filter to a JSON representation.
- `void fromJSON(dynamic json)` – Populates the filter from a JSON object.

---

## `DateFilter`

The `DateFilter` class extends `AbstractNumberFilter` to support filtering of `DateTime` fields. It uses date-time values for operations and converts them to and from ISO 8601 string format.

**Methods:**

- `Map<String, dynamic> toJSON()` – Converts the filter to a JSON representation with date-time values in ISO 8601 format.
- `void fromJSON(dynamic json)` – Populates the filter from a JSON object with date-time values.

---

## `DoubleFilter`, `IntFilter`, `NumberFilter`

These classes extend `AbstractNumberFilter` for specific number types:

- **`DoubleFilter`** – For `double` values.
- **`IntFilter`** – For `int` values.
- **`NumberFilter`** – For `num` values.

They inherit filtering operations from `AbstractNumberFilter` but are specialized for their respective types.

---

## `GuidFilter`

The `GuidFilter` class extends `AbstractIdFilter` for `String` type IDs, often used for GUIDs.

**Methods:**

- `Map<String, dynamic> toJSON()` – Converts the filter to a JSON representation.
- `void fromJSON(dynamic json)` – Populates the filter from a JSON object.

---

## `StringFilter`

The `StringFilter` class provides filtering operations for `String` fields. It includes operations for equality, containment, and string matching.

**Properties:**

- `String? equal` – Value to match.
- `String? notEqual` – Value to exclude.
- `String? startWith` – Value that the field should start with.
- `String? notStartWith` – Value that the field should not start with.
- `String? endWith` – Value that the field should end with.
- `String? notEndWith` – Value that the field should not end with.
- `String? contain` – Value that should be contained in the field.
- `String? notContain` – Value that should not be contained in the field.

**Methods:**

- `Map<String, dynamic> toJSON()` – Converts the filter to a JSON representation.
- `void fromJSON(dynamic json)` – Populates the filter from a JSON object.
