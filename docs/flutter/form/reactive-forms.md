# Reactive forms

A form built with the reactive_forms package, which provides a robust way to handle
form state management in Flutter.

The reactive_forms package offers benefits such as:
- Declarative API for building forms
- Built-in validation
- Handling form state (touched, dirty, etc.)
- Form control grouping
- Form arrays for dynamic fields

Use this form when you need:
- Complex validation logic
- Dynamic form fields
- Fine-grained control over form state
- Reactive programming approach to forms
- To separate form logic from UI
